\section*{Introduction}
   Bangladesh is an over populated country but still many peoples of Bangladesh don't get blood in the needy moments.Bangladesh gets it's 31 percent of blood from the donor and this percentage is very low, compared to other countries in South-East Asia, such as Thailand, India and Sri-Lanka, where the number reaches as high as 95 percent.So we need a trustful blood bank and if people can directly access to the blood bank it will be more beneficial and time saving. This is the main reason we are launching this website so that people can donate and buy blood through registering in the website with their "NID" cards.

        \item  people can get to know the availability of specific blood groups.
   \end{itemize}
